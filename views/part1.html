            <h2>--- Day 10: Monitoring Station ---</h2>
            <h2 class="display-1">Part 1</h2>
            <h3 class="display-2">Task</h3>
            <p>You fly into the asteroid belt and reach the Ceres monitoring station.  The Elves here have an emergency: they're having trouble tracking all of the asteroids and can't be sure they're safe.</p>
            <p>The Elves would like to build a new monitoring station in a nearby area of space; they hand you a map of all of the asteroids in that region (your puzzle input).</p>
            <p>The map indicates whether each position is empty (<code>.</code>) or contains an asteroid (<code>#</code>).  The asteroids are much smaller than they appear on the map, and every asteroid is exactly in the center of its marked position.  The asteroids can be described with <code>X,Y</code> coordinates where <code>X</code> is the distance from the left edge and <code>Y</code> is the distance from the top edge (so the top-left corner is <code>0,0</code> and the position immediately to its right is <code>1,0</code>).</p>
            <p>Your job is to figure out which asteroid would be the best place to build a <em>new monitoring station</em>. A monitoring station can <em>detect</em> any asteroid to which it has <em>direct line of sight</em> - that is, there cannot be another asteroid <em>exactly</em> between them. This line of sight can be at any angle, not just lines aligned to the grid or <span title="The Elves on Ceres are clearly not concerned with honor.">diagonally</span>. The <em>best</em> location is the asteroid that can <em>detect</em> the largest number of other asteroids.</p>
            <p>For example, consider the following map:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>.#..#
.....
#####
....#
...<em>#</em>#
</code></pre>
            <p>The best location for a new monitoring station on this map is the highlighted asteroid at <code>3,4</code> because it can detect <code>8</code> asteroids, more than any other location. (The only asteroid it cannot detect is the one at <code>1,0</code>; its view of this asteroid is blocked by the asteroid at <code>2,2</code>.) All other asteroids are worse locations; they can detect <code>7</code> or fewer other asteroids. Here is the number of other asteroids a monitoring station on each asteroid could detect:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>.7..7
.....
67775
....7
...87
</code></pre>
            <p>Here is an asteroid (<code>#</code>) and some examples of the ways its line of sight might be blocked. If there were another asteroid at the location of a capital letter, the locations marked with the corresponding lowercase letter would be blocked and could not be detected:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>#.........
...A......
...B..a...
.EDCG....a
..F.c.b...
.....c....
..efd.c.gb
.......c..
....f...c.
...e..d..c
</code></pre>
            <p>Here are some larger examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Best is <code>5,8</code> with <code>33</code> other asteroids detected:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>......#.#.

</code></pre></li>
                <li><p>Best is <code>1,2</code> with <code>35</code> other asteroids detected:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>#.#...#.#.

                <li><p>Best is <code>6,3</code> with <code>41</code> other asteroids detected:</p>
                    <pre>

        <h3 class="display-2">Solution</h3>

        <p>The grid below shows the number of asteroids each asteroid can see. The best is highlighted Yellow:</p>
